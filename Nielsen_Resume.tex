%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

\item[] \textit{Research Engineer}, \href{http://www.moriassociates.com/}{\textbf{MORi Associates, Inc.}} % 
\hfill{Feb 2013 to Oct 2016}

  \begin{innerlist}
    \item I worked in the Data Sciences group to tackle the problem of discovering, explaining and predicting safety and operational incidents in aviation through the use of data mining and machine learning techniques.
    \item I created novel anomaly detection algorithms to discover and investigate landings at four of the largest US airports. These algorithms improved upon the state of the art machine learning techniques and the results were published in {\sc IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conferences} and {\sc 2016 World Congress on Computational Intelligence}.
    \item I developed using the {\sc Python} scientific stack ({\sc NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn}) in a  {\sc Linux} environment with {\sc git} for version control. I also built {\sc Shell Scripts} for data management on our local network.
%     \item Aviation safety incidents are rare and domain experts' time is expensive so we are developing an active learning framework in Python to improve the output of our discovery algorithms. We bring an expert into the machine learning loop to label the most uncertain flights which allow us to classify more safety relevant flights with less expert time. 
%       \item I have been utilizing established aviation incident definitions to find interesting events in largely unlabeled and unknown datasets through the use of multiple parameter queries and data mining techniques. By enriching the data with these new features I was able to greatly increase the scope of the problems we could address with our algorithms.   
%    \item We used one-class support vector machines to discover and investigate anomalies during landings at four of the largest US airports. This allowed us to sift through the vast number of unlabeled flights and discuss the most operationally significant with aviation experts. This brought novel safety-related situations to their attention and the results were summarized in series of papers published in IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conferences. 
%    \item I was able to utilize aviation experts' feedback to create a labeled set of flights to validate our anomaly detection algorithms. We used this dataset to baseline an extreme learning machine neural net against state-of-the-art techniques which lead to paper to be presented at the 2016 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence.
  %  \item I have been coordinating with graduate students, facility managers, and IT folks to create a real-time PostgreSQL database with PostGIS integration to collect and store all the disparate data sources from NASA Sustainability Base for use in research and operations.
